    <p id='heading1'> Introduction
    </p>
    <p>I am doing a project on deforestation. I would like to improve awarness about deforestation, why it happens and How we can individually stop it.
    </p>
    <p id='heading1'> Action
    </p>
    <p> My project action is that want to spread awarness about house plants that can also increase the plants in the enviroments.

    <p id='heading1'>What is deforestation?

    <p> Deforesttion is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from landthat is then converted into farms, ranches or urban use. Deferestation also happens when wood or log trees is taken away for vilagers domestic fuel and for making furniture. People cut down trees to make paper out it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p id='heading1'> Reasons
    </p>
    <p> Trees can be cut down naturally or Man made.
    </p>
    <p> Naturally
    </p>
    <p> Wildfires - Wildfires happen when trees burn to the ground and it affects animals too.
    <p> Landslides - When landslides fall they can crush the trees and the trees may be destroyed.
    <p> Droughts - drought happen trees will nto have water to grow.
    <p> Volcanos - When volcanos erupt then it will make a big erruption with fire and wind and ava will come so trees can get cut down.
    </p>
    <p> Man made
    </p>
    <p> Agricultre - The number 1 reasons for deforestation is people cutting down trees for agriculture and live stock
        (A)Local farmerscut down treesto grow crops and eat them selves(Subsistance Agriculture).(B)Commerical Agriculture:Big farmers cutting down trees to make large farmes for cropsto sell.(C)Livestock:Big and small farmers rear cattle, (Cows,goats and sheep) for milk and meat. This cattle need large open spaces for survival and growing, this is also another reason to cut down forests.
    </p>
    <p> Urbanization- Our population is growing. There by people need places to live so people are cutting down trees in forests to build and make cities and towns or villages. People are also cutting down trees to make Furniture, Medicines, Paper and logs.
    </p>
    <p> Mining Activities- People cut down trees down trees and forests to dig deep inside the ground ot get mierals and rocks.

    <p id='heading1'> Project Objecive
    </p>
    <p> To influence people or to make them aware that deforestation is happening at a huge extend, much damage is being done from loss of trees and forest area's. However the trees loss cannot all be replanted soon or to match the numbers. Air quality is suffering and pollutants are harming the world. Oxygen made by trees is becoming precious. So you can plant more house plants which can copy the benefits of trees to some extent. House plants purify air and create oxgen for people.

    <p id='heading1'> Project Tools
    </p>
    <p>
    <p> I have done a survey using google forms seeking poeples inputs on how much they are aware of deforestation and the benefits of house plants. Post collection of survey answers I made bar graphs to show peoples responses to my questions. The survey was answered by 44 people. It included both adults and children. I present the conclusions below.
        <hr>
    <p id='heading1'> Conclusion:1
    </p>
    <p> Most of the people were not aware of the extent of deforestation. There are 3.5 to 7.0 billion trees cut every year. Only 21 people out of 44 respondents were ale to tell the correct answer. 23 people thought that less number of trees are cut down every year.

    <p id='heading1'> Conclusion:2
    </p>
    <p> Most of the popel agreed with me that house plants can reduce the bad affects of deforestation. Out of the 44 people surveyed, 40 people perfered planting trees to aid Aforestation. And a close 39 respondents agreed that house plants can improve Aforestation. Only 12 people opted to grow creepers as a way to increase gree cover.

    <p id='heading1'> Conclusion:3
    </p>
    <p> Majority of the respondents chose to plant Areca palms in their homes as the most preferred house plant. In the questions on people's preference for which types of four given air puryfying plants, we found that maximum votes went for Areca Palm and least went for Golden pathos, which is a kind of a money plant. People rated Aloe Vera as second most prefered house plant. Rubber plant was also not so popullar though it has good benifits to clean air and remove toxins from the enviroment.
